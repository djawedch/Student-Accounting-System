# Chapter 1: General Introduction

## 1.1 Project Context

Digital transformation today affects all sectors, including higher education. University institutions are increasingly faced with the need to modernize their administrative and financial management systems to improve the efficiency of internal processes and the quality of services offered to students.

In this context, student accounting management, particularly the tracking of tuition fees, billing, payment registration, and scholarship allocation, constitutes a major challenge. Traditional methods based on manual procedures or non-integrated tools (paper documents, spreadsheets) present several limitations: lack of traceability, risk of errors, slow processing, and low visibility for students.

This project is therefore part of a digitalization approach aimed at proposing a centralized, reliable, and secure IT solution for student accounting management.

## 1.2 Problem Statement

The absence of a unified computerized system for managing tuition fees creates several problems, such as:

- Difficulties in accurately tracking payments made by students
- Complex management of invoices and payment delays
- A lack of transparency for students regarding their financial situation
- Difficulty for the administration to audit and control the operations carried out

Faced with these observations, it becomes necessary to design an application that automates these processes while guaranteeing the security and integrity of financial data.

## 1.3 Project Objectives

The main objective of this project is to design and develop a web application dedicated to student accounting management.

The specific objectives are as follows:

- Set up a management system for students and their tuition fees
- Automate the generation and tracking of invoices Record and track payments made outside the system
- Manage the allocation of scholarships and their impact on the amounts to be paid
- Offer students clear visibility of their financial situation
- Ensure traceability and control of administrative actions

## 1.4 Project Scope

The project covers the essential functionalities necessary for effective student accounting management. It is primarily aimed at three types of users: the Super Administrator, the Administrator, and the Student.

The application will allow the management of fees, invoices, payments, and scholarships within an academic framework. Payments are not processed by the system but are recorded after being performed externally (cash, bank transfer, etc.). Advanced hardware, legal, and accounting aspects are not supported within the scope of this project, which focuses on an academic software solution.

## 1.5 Thesis Organization
